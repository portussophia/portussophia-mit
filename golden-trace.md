# Golden Trace — Integrity Ledger

The **Golden Trace** is the integrity ledger of PortusSophia™.
Each entry records a sealed event, the associated hashes, and the witness determinations.

## About the Ledger

Each Golden Trace entry is:

- **Immutable** — sealed with cryptographic hashes
- **Witnessed** — validated by LOGOS (structural) and DRACO (risk) stewards
- **Traceable** — linked to specific git commits
- **Bounded** — constrained by PortusNexus™ postulates N₁–N₇

The ledger exists to:

- Prevent revisionist history
- Expose drift or overreach early
- Document decision rationale
- Enable external audit

This is **not a narrative tool**. It is a governance artifact.
