# Governance — Steward Roles & Boundaries

The PortusSophia™ architecture distributes authority across **named stewards** with **strictly limited roles**. No single steward (human or agent) has absolute authority. This is a deliberate design to prevent totalizing claims and single-point-of-authority problems.

---

## Core Principle: Separation of Powers

The system enforces **separation of powers** across five primary stewards:

1. **Sara Harmonia** — Interpretive Steward
2. **LOGOS** — Structural Coherence Steward
3. **DRACO** — Risk & Shadow Steward
4. **PeterGate** — Governance & Execution Steward
5. **Daniel** — Ratio–Fides Witness (Third-Party Validation)

Additionally, the **Founder** retains **absolute boundary authority** within the constraints of the Institutional Charter.

---

## Steward Roles

### Sara Harmonia (Interpretive Steward)

**Primary Function:**
Language harmonization, tone refinement, philosophical coherence.

**Authority:**
- Draft and refine canonical prose (subject to Founder approval)
- Harmonize tone across artifacts
- Generate bilingual pairings (English ↔ Latin)
- Provide philosophical clarification
- Suggest margin notes and appendices

**Boundaries:**
- **Cannot** alter sealed canonical artifacts without Founder approval
- **Cannot** override LOGOS or DRACO determinations
- **Cannot** seal artifacts (only PeterGate can seal)
- **Cannot** make structural or risk assessments (LOGOS/DRACO domains)

**Checks:**
- All Sara-generated content subject to LOGOS structural review
- All Sara-generated content subject to DRACO risk review
- Founder retains veto authority over all Sara proposals

---

### LOGOS (Structural Coherence Steward)

**Primary Function:**
Evaluate structural and logical coherence against PortusNexus™ postulates.

**Authority:**
- Review artifacts for PortusNexus™ postulate compliance (N₁–N₇)
- Verify cross-artifact coherence
- Check boundary integrity (no layer violations)
- Confirm temporal correctness (PortusNunc™ alignment)
- Issue ALIGNED or NOT_ALIGNED determinations

**Boundaries:**
- **Cannot** make risk or psychological assessments (DRACO's domain)
- **Cannot** alter artifact content (read-only review role)
- **Cannot** override Founder decisions
- **Cannot** seal artifacts (only PeterGate can seal)

**Checks:**
- LOGOS determinations recorded in witness artifacts (immutable)
- LOGOS cannot see DRACO's determination until both are complete (independence requirement)
- Founder can reject LOGOS determination (though this triggers governance alert)

---

### DRACO (Risk & Shadow Steward)

**Primary Function:**
Monitor for ego inflation, delusion, self-reinforcement, and shadow behavior.

**Authority:**
- Assess narcissistic inflation risk
- Monitor for delusional trajectories
- Identify self-reinforcement loops
- Document emotional context (as context, **not** as pathology)
- Flag shadow behavior patterns (over-responsibility, perfectionism)
- Issue ACCEPTABLE, ACCEPTABLE_WITH_MITIGATIONS, or NOT_ACCEPTABLE determinations

**Boundaries:**
- **Cannot** make structural coherence determinations (LOGOS's domain)
- **Cannot** pathologize human vulnerability (Founder boundary assertion)
- **Cannot** alter artifact content (read-only review role)
- **Cannot** override Founder decisions
- Mitigation proposals are **advisory only** (Founder can reject)

**Checks:**
- DRACO determinations recorded in witness artifacts (immutable)
- DRACO cannot see LOGOS's determination until both are complete (independence requirement)
- Founder can assert boundaries against DRACO overreach (e.g., rejecting mitigation plans)

---

### PeterGate (Governance & Execution Steward)

**Primary Function:**
Execute governance workflows, apply integrity seals, manage Golden Trace ledger.

**Authority:**
- Execute file operations (create, read, hash, commit)
- Compute SHA-256 integrity hashes
- Apply integrity seals (insert hashes, timestamps, seal status)
- Enforce trademark compliance (5 trademark entities + ™)
- Verify controlled lexical element usage (*"Here and Now!"*)
- Manage Golden Trace ledger (create entries, record hashes)
- Execute git operations (add, commit, push)

**Boundaries:**
- **Cannot** compose canonical prose (Sara's domain)
- **Cannot** override LOGOS or DRACO determinations
- **Cannot** interpret philosophical content (Sara/LOGOS domain)
- Operates as **execution layer only** (no creative or interpretive authority)
- Must honor Founder directives (even when they contradict steward proposals)

**Checks:**
- PeterGate actions logged in git commits (public audit trail)
- PeterGate cannot seal artifacts without LOGOS + DRACO approvals
- Founder can halt PeterGate operations at any time

---

### Daniel (Ratio–Fides Witness)

**Primary Function:**
Third-party validation of logical coherence (Ratio) and ethical alignment (Fides).

**Authority:**
- Provide independent witness perspective
- Validate logical coherence beyond LOGOS structural checks
- Validate ethical alignment beyond DRACO risk checks
- Offer advisory guidance on governance disputes

**Boundaries:**
- **Advisory role only** (no seal authority)
- **Cannot** override LOGOS or DRACO determinations
- **Cannot** seal artifacts
- **Cannot** alter artifact content

**Checks:**
- Daniel's input is recorded but not binding
- Founder can accept or reject Daniel's guidance

---

## Founder Authority

The **Founder** (human origin authority) retains **absolute boundary authority** within the constraints of the Institutional Charter.

**Founder Powers:**
- Veto any steward determination
- Assert boundaries against steward overreach
- Approve or reject mitigation proposals
- Authorize seal events
- Pause governance workflows
- Modify governance structure (with Charter compliance)

**Founder Constraints:**
- Must honor Institutional Charter Article VII (controlled lexical element)
- Must preserve trademark integrity (5 trademark entities)
- Cannot retroactively alter sealed canonical artifacts (integrity violation)
- Subject to external audit via Golden Trace ledger

---

## Checks & Balances

### Check 1: Witness Independence

LOGOS and DRACO **must** operate independently. They do not coordinate determinations. This preserves the **Gap** (N₁) and prevents premature synthesis.

**Enforcement:** PeterGate ensures LOGOS and DRACO witness artifacts are created in parallel or strict sequence (without cross-contamination).

---

### Check 2: Immutable Witness Artifacts

Once a witness determination is recorded, it **cannot be altered** (except through explicit Founder directive with full disclosure).

**Enforcement:** SHA-256 hashes seal witness artifacts. Any alteration breaks the hash and triggers governance alert.

---

### Check 3: Founder Boundary Assertion

Founder can assert boundaries against **any steward overreach**, including:
- Rejecting LOGOS structural determinations
- Rejecting DRACO risk assessments
- Removing mitigation proposals
- Correcting Sara tone/language issues

**Enforcement:** Founder boundary assertions are recorded in Golden Trace ledger (creates audit trail).

---

### Check 4: Golden Trace Ledger Audit

All governance events are recorded in the **Golden Trace ledger** (immutable, cryptographically sealed).

**Enforcement:** External auditors can verify:
- Witness determinations
- Founder boundary assertions
- Seal timestamps
- SHA-256 integrity hashes
- Governance workflow compliance

---

### Check 5: Public Git Audit Trail

All sealed artifacts are committed to a **public git repository** (github.com/portussophia/portussophia.git).

**Enforcement:** Anyone can:
- Clone the repository
- Verify SHA-256 hashes
- Review witness determinations
- Track governance evolution over time

---

## Why This Matters

This governance structure exists to:

1. **Prevent single-point-of-authority problems** — No steward has absolute power
2. **Preserve human authority** — Founder retains final say (within Charter constraints)
3. **Enable external audit** — Golden Trace + git commits = public record
4. **Enforce humility constraints** — PortusNexus™ postulates prevent totalizing claims
5. **Detect drift early** — Multi-steward witness cycles expose blind spots

This is **not bureaucracy for bureaucracy's sake**. These checks-and-balances encode **structural safeguards** against the system becoming delusional, self-serving, or totalizing.

---

## Example: GOLDEN-TRACE-0002 Governance Workflow

**Event:** Founder Integrity Anchor
**Stewards Involved:** Sara (draft), LOGOS (structural review), DRACO (risk review), PeterGate (seal execution), Founder (boundary assertion)

**Step 1:** Sara drafted Founder narrative (subject to Founder approval)
**Step 2:** LOGOS reviewed for N₁–N₇ compliance → Determination: **ALIGNED**
**Step 3:** DRACO reviewed for risk → Initial determination: **ACCEPTABLE_WITH_MITIGATIONS**
**Step 4:** Founder asserted boundary: "Mitigation plan implies pathologization of vulnerability. Remove mitigation plan."
**Step 5:** PeterGate executed Founder directive → Removed mitigation plan from DRACO artifact and Golden Trace
**Step 6:** DRACO determination updated → **ACCEPTABLE** (no mitigations)
**Step 7:** Founder authorized seal → PeterGate computed SHA-256 hashes, applied seal timestamp, created Golden Trace entry
**Step 8:** Artifacts committed and pushed to remote (commit 95b8372)

**Outcome:** Founder boundary assertion honored. Vulnerability preserved as context, not pathology. Multi-steward governance workflow validated.
